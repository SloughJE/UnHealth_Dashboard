health_score_explanation = """
The Health Score provides a comprehensive overview of a county's health by combining data on various health indicators, such as the prevalence of chronic diseases, lifestyle factors, and disabilities. A higher score indicates a higher prevalence of poor health indicators. Each indicator is assigned an impact score, reflecting its significance on public health. High-impact indicators include stroke, diabetes, and cancer, among others, while lower-impact indicators cover aspects like sleep duration and health screenings.


The process involves normalizing data across all indicators to create a score out of 100, where a higher score signals more significant health challenges within the county. This normalized score allows for direct comparison across counties, offering insights into areas needing most health-related interventions and support.
